    "Exercise 2: Bayesian A/B testing for Swedish Fish Incorporated with Stan \n",
    "============ \n",
    "### *Rasmus Bååth (adapted for Python by Christophe Carvenius)*\n",
    "Swedish Fish Incorporated is the largest Swedish company delivering fish by mail order, but you probably already knew that. The marketing department have done a pilot study and tried two different marketing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Sending a mail with a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B:** Sending a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription *and that includes a free salmon*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing department sent out 16 mails of type A and 16 mails of type B. Six Danes that received a mail of type A signed up for one year of salmon, and ten Danes that received a mail of type B signed up!\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing department now wants to know, which method should we use, A or B?\n",
    "\n",
    "*At the bottom of this document you’ll find a solution. But try yourself first!*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: Build a Bayesian model in Stan that answers the question: What is the probability that method B is better than method A?\n",
    "**Hint 1:** As part of you generative model you’ll want to use the binomial distribution, which you can use in Stan like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`s ~ binomial(size, rate);`\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be read as: The number of successes `s` is distributed as a binomial distribution with `size` trials, where the rate of success is `rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** A commonly used prior for the unknown probability of success in a binomial distribution is a uniform distribution from 0 to 1. You can use this distribution in Stan like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rate ~  uniform(0, 1);`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** Here is a code scaffold that you can build upon which estimates the rate for one group. For an A/B test you would have to extend this model to include two groups. Comparing the rates of the two groups can be done either in the `generated quantities` block in Stan or by post-processing the samples from the stan model."

    "The marketing department are starting to believe that it was a fluke that such a large proportion of the Danes signed up. In all other European markets the proportion that signs up for a year of salmon is around 5% to 15%, even when given a free salmon. Use this information and make the priors in your model more informative.\n",

    "**Hint 1:** This can be done in a million ways and there isn’t any “right” answer to this question. Just do something quick ’n dirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** It would however be cool if you used a prior that wasn’t uniform. A good distribution, when crafting priors with support over [0, 1], is the beta distribution. You can sample from a beta distribution using `random.beta(alpha, beta, size = 1)` function in numpy, where `alpha` and `beta` defines the shape of the distribution."
